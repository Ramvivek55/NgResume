    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and abilities to build
      apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop.</p>
  
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it further, via Web

      your own components and use a wide array of existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific
      help and feedback with nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can focus
      on building amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.</p>
  
    <h3>Experience</h3>
